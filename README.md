# Description

This repository is a collection of examples of contracts and programs that can be deployed and used on Hylé.

Hylé does not have a native execution environment, smart contracts do not execute code on Hylé, they describe a verifiation logic for a particular program. 


See the [documentation](https://docs.hyle.eu/developers/using-the-cli/your-first-smart-contract/) to learn more.
